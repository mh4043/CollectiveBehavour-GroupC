# Collective Behaviour - Group C
We will be reviewing and recreating a collective behaviour algorithm for herding sheep by a sheepdog presented in paper by [Liu et al](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9549396). [[1]](#1). We will simulate an environment with predetermined starting positions of all sheep and the sheepdog, while also creating a sheepfold as a final goal for the sheep. We will review the performance of the algorithms presented in paper, while also trying to implement some new and compare the results.

## Conclusions
In our work, more specifically in the implementation itself, we also used some rigorous equations. Some detailed explanations can be found [here](https://github.com/mh4043/CollectiveBehavour-GroupC/blob/main/docs/variables%20and%20equations%20descriptions.md). More detailed steps of the basic algorithm can be found [here](https://github.com/mh4043/CollectiveBehavour-GroupC/blob/main/docs/algorithm%20description.md).

## How to run - instructions
There are some Python packages required to be installed, in order to be able to run the program. Check [here](https://github.com/mh4043/CollectiveBehavour-GroupC/blob/main/code/requirements.txt).
